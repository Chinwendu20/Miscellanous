## Presrequisites

1. You would need an lnd, lightningd and bitcoind binary in your PATH to run 
   this test.

Recommended to build the binary with these repos here, to ensure compatibility:

- [`lightningd`](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/tree/95a92b6e4bf521456c1188ac8ecea2a49fa5f22f)
- [`lnd`](https://github.com/Chinwendu20/lnd/tree/peer-backup)

## Notes

This directory currently contains interoperability test for the peer backup 
feature between core lightning and lnd.
